Problem Statement:
Create a Java program that simulates a simple online shopping cart. The program should allow users to add items to the cart, view the cart, and calculate the total price of the items in the cart.

Requirements:

The program should have two classes: Product and ShoppingCart.
The Product class should have the following attributes: productId, name, and price.
The ShoppingCart class should have an ArrayList to store the products added to the cart.
The ShoppingCart class should have the following methods:
addItem(Product product): Adds a product to the cart.
removeItem(Product product): Removes a product from the cart.
viewCart(): Displays the products in the cart along with their details.
calculateTotalPrice(): Calculates and returns the total price of all the products in the cart.
The program should provide a menu-based interface to interact with the shopping cart. The menu should include options to add an item, remove an item, view the cart, and calculate the total price. 
The program should continue to display the menu until the user chooses to exit.
